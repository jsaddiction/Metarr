- Archive old completed tasks monthly
- Use simple checkbox format for clarity

### Session Continuity
This file answers "what next?" when starting a new session or switching machines:
1. Read this file first

3. Review "Next Up" for priorities
4. Update after completing work

### Maintenance
- Review weekly to ensure priorities are current
- Archive completed tasks older than 30 days
- Keep "Next Up" focused (max 5-7 items)
- Be specific in task descriptions
